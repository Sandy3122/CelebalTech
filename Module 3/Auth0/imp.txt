Description: Implemented authentication mechanisms in a web application to verify the identity of users. 
Explored various types of authentication, including:

Authentication : 
What do you meant by authentication ?
Authentication is the process of verifying a user or device before allowing access to a system or protected resources.

What do you meant by Authorization ?
Authorization, on the other hand, is the process of granting or denying access rights and permissions to authenticated users or entities.



Types Of Authentication :
1. Username and Password: Users provide a unique username and password combination for authentication.
2. Token-based Authentication: Utilized tokens, such as JSON Web Tokens (JWT), to authenticate and authorize users by exchanging and verifying tokens.
3. OAuth: Integrated OAuth protocol to enable third-party authentication, allowing users to sign in using existing accounts from platforms like Google, Facebook, or Twitter.
4. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Implemented an additional layer of security by requiring users to provide a second authentication factor, such as a unique code sent to their mobile device.
5. Biometric Authentication: Utilized biometric data, such as fingerprints or facial recognition, to authenticate users on devices with biometric sensors.

These authentication methods enhance the security of web applications by ensuring only authorized users can access protected resources.






Passwords :
1. Implementing proper password strength controls such as password length, complexity, and topology.
2. Implementing secure password recovery mechanisms.
3. Storing passwords securely, which includes hashing passwords with a salt.
4. Transmitting passwords only over TLS or other strong transport.
5. Correctly implementing authentication and error messages that mitigate user ID and password enumeration.
6. Must Preventing brute-force attacks.
