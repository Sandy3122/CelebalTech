**** Scope ****
1. Block Scope  
2. Functional Scope  
3. Global Scope

//Reassign
1. variable with var or let, you can reassign a new value to the variable in your programming flow. It is possible if the variable is accessible to assign a value. 
2. But with const, you can't reassign a new value at all.

//Redeclaration
1. Var  -   YES
2. Let  -   NO
3. Const    -   NO  


//Hosting
1. With var in non-strict mode, the variable will have an undefined value
2. In strict mode, you will get a ReferenceError that the variable is not declared.
3. With let and const, if you try to access a variable before declaring, you will always get a ReferenceError.


//IMPORTANT
1. Don't use var anymore.
2. Use let or const.
3. Use const more often. Use let when you need to reassign another value to a variable.
4. Don't try to access a variable without declaring it.
